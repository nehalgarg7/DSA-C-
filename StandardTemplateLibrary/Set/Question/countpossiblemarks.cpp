 * Given the number of questions as n , and marks for the correct answer as p and q marks for the incorrect answer. 
 * One can either attempt to solve the question in an examination and get either p marks if the answer is right, or q marks if the answer is wrong, 
 * or leave the question unattended and get 0     marks. The task is to find the count of all the different possible marks that one can score in the examination.

    Examples    
        Input: n = 2, p = 1, q = -1
        Output: 5
        The different possible marks are: -2, -1, 0, 1, 
            
        Input: n = 4, p = 2, q = -1
        Output: 12
